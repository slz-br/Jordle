***Briefly Explained:***
<p> A Wordle clone that uses java. </p>

***How does it work?***
<p> The application randomly selects a word from a txt as the word to guess, <br>
then, the user has to input a word that contains 4 letters, this input passes through a method that checks<br>
if the word is elegible(has exactly 4 letters and is an existing word), after all this, the input word will<br>
be compared to the word to guess.</p>

***Story:***
<p> This was my first java project, I was kinda putting everything I learned togheter in this project, in <br>
the end this project taught me quitea bit. </p>
